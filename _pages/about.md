I am a Lecturer (Asst. Prof.) in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the <a href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/">Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems</a> at the University of Lincoln UK and an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA).

The aims of my research are endowing robots with the capabilities to operate autonomously in everyday human environments and to interact with people in a socially appropriate fashion. To this end, I develop methodologies for <a href="/projects/learning/">robot learning from human feedback</a>, for enabling and studying <a href="/projects/perception/">social perception in human-robot interactions</a>, and for <a href="/projects/autonomy/">assuring robot autonomy</a>.

I am actively involved in <a href="/projects/competitions/">robotics competitions</a> for the advancement of the state-of-the-art in robotics and AI, and for introducing students to research topics in these fields. In 2023 I founded the <a href="https://lcastor.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk">LCASTOR</a> team, which participates annually to RoboCup @HOME competitions.

Before, I was a Post-Doctoral Research Associate working in the <a href="https://www.tas.ac.uk/research-projects-2022-23/tarics">TARICS project</a>, and a PhD student advised by <a href="https://www.hanheide.net/">Prof. Marc Hanheide</a> in the <a href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/projects/lindsey-a-robot-tour-guide/">"Lindsey, the tour guide robot" project</a>. I graduated from Sapienza University of Rome with a MSc in “Artificial Intelligence and Robotics” advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/dis.uniroma1.it/iocchi/home">Prof. Luca Iocchi</a> and from the University of Bologna with a BSc in “Computer Science and Engineering” advised by <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/andrea.roli/en">Prof. Andrea Roli</a>.
